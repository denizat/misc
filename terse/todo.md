Plan:
I want to make this a very simple 2d graphics engine where you can just change the
value and color of a coordinate at a determined point or at the cursor.

I want to implement simple multi-threading so that we can render and take in input at the same time.

How the library should be used?
You call a window initializtion function.
You either do a render on user input loop or you split the two into two threads so you can have things
like snake.

Would like to make tetris, snake, and minesweeper with this. Also a terminal animation tool.

Also with some overhaul, I would like to make some animations with windows using transparent points.
